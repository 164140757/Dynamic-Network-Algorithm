HSV-1,KHSV,mCMV,VZV,EBV network, named "HSVNet.txt,KHSVNet.txt,CMVNet.txt,VZVNet.txt,EBVNet.txt" respectively.
The file "table.HSV-CMV.txt" and other table files are the homologous tables between two species, obtained by the fasta files in fasta directory.
A MIPS file lists all proteins in one network. For example, "MIPS-HSV.txt" contains all proteins in HSVNet.txt, and 'HSV-48' is the network name.
