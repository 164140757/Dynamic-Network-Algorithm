# Hybrid Hungarian and Greedy Algorithm(HGA)

### How to run 

First you have to build by maven

```
mvn compile
```

Then, please navigate to the pom.xml file from the root, and comment the < skipTests > line in the plugin, then your tests could work.

```
 <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>${maven-surefire-plugin.version}</version>
                <configuration>
                      <!-- <skipTests>true</skipTests> -->
                </configuration>
 </plugin>

```

In your server command line, input the follow command

```
nohup mvn clean test -Dtest=Algorithms.Graph.HGA.HGARunSpec#<test> &
```

< test > can be any junit test class method, for example, < test > can be run_yeast like example below:

```java
 @Test
    void run_yeast() throws IOException {
         // reader for reading undirected graphs and the similarity matrix
        GraphFileReader reader = new GraphFileReader(true, false, false);
        // read graphs with the file path
        undG1 = reader.readToUndirectedGraph("src/test/java/resources/TestModule/HGATestData/Human-YeastSub38N/net-38n.txt", false);
        undG2 = reader.readToUndirectedGraph("src/test/java/resources/TestModule/HGATestData/Human-YeastSub38N/HumanNet.txt", false);
        // undirected graphs don't have to record neighbors
        reader.setRecordNeighbors(false);
        // read the simMat 
        simMat = reader.readToSimMat("src/test/java/resources/TestModule/HGATestData/Human-YeastSub38N/fasta/yeastHumanSimList_EvalueLessThan1e-10.txt",
                undG1.getAllNodes(), undG2.getAllNodes(), true);
        // hga init
        hga = new HGA(simMat, undG1, undG2, 0.4,true,0.5,0.01);
        // specify where you want the log matrix, score, and mapping result.
        HGA.debugOutputPath = "src\\test\\java\\resources\\Jupiter\\data\\";
        hga.run();
    }
```

Notice: the similarity matrix is consist of the index graph's nodes as its rows, and the target graph's as its columns.

The matrix's size should be equal to or more than m*n as it has to cover all pairs. 



It's flexible for you to write a new test method for your customized design and purpose.



If you would like to check the status of the current mapping, there is a HGALogFile.log in the root path.

When the matrix has converged, it will be an output information to denote that all iterations needed have been finished.

### GPU acceleration 

The algorithm is still complicated as updating the matrix with topological information will be tedious. The time complexity will be (n*m)^2, for more information on how to implement this method, please visit my blog [here](http://www.haotian.life/2020/07/28/new-feature-gpu-for-hga/).

```
@Test
void run_test_GPU() throws IOException {
        GraphFileReader reader = new GraphFileReader(true, false, false);
        undG1 = reader.readToUndirectedGraph("src/test/java/resources/AlgTest/HGA/graph1.txt", false);
        undG2 = reader.readToUndirectedGraph("src/test/java/resources/AlgTest/HGA/graph2.txt", false);
        reader.setRecordNeighbors(false);
        simMat = reader.readToSimMat("src/test/java/resources/AlgTest/HGA/simMat.txt", undG1.getAllNodes(), undG2.getAllNodes(), true);
        hga = new HGA(simMat, undG1, undG2, 0.5,true,0.5,0.01);
        HGA.GPU = true;
        hga.run();
}
```

To enable GPU, just set HGA.GPU to true, but you should firstly make sure both drivers and environments have been properly set up. There are ample resources on the topic of how to make GPU work, and I will not explain it further.
